        <div class="column"><h2 >What is  Disability claim? </h2>
            <p>A disability claim is a request for income assistance filed with the Social Security Administration.
                 A claim is filed when a person believes that a mental or 
                 physical disability leads to his/her inability to lead a normal life or find a job. 
                 Depending on your medical and financial history, you can either file for Social Security Disability Insurance or 
                 Supplemental Security Income.</p>
                </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Gathering necessary information</h2>
            <p >Gathering the necessary evidence can be a rather time consuming and complicated process. 
                Thus, it is recommended that one hires a Social <br>Security Disability attorney before beginning the application process.<br>
                 Usually, an attorney will not collect any fees unless you win your case. <br>
                 Typical attorney fees are about 25% of the claim that has been awarded <br> to you.
                  An attorney can receive no more $6,000 for winning a <br>Social Security Disability case. 
                To contact a disability attorney or advocate who can review your case at no charge, please fill out our Free Evaluation.</p>

        <h2>How to File a Disability Claim</h2>
        <p>A disability claim can either be filed yourself or through a disability advocate. 
            Before filing a claim, an applicant should be able to prove that he/she is expected
             to be out of work for at least a year due to a permanent disability. One should also make sure 
             that there are sufficient medical documents and physicianâ€™s opinions to confirm the existence and severity of the disabling condition.
              You must not be able to perform your previous job nor
               should you be able to get a different job that would pay you in excess of $1,000/month.</p>
